            <h2> HTML Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>
                <p>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML is the foundation of web pages, is used for webpage development by structuring websites and web apps.</li>
                <li>An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using .html or .htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</li>

            <article>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
                <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>

            <h2> CSS Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser. </p>
                <p>While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</li>
                <li>Easy Maintenance: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</li>
                <li>Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.</li>
                <li>Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
                <li>Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.</li>
            </ul>

            <article>
                <p>CSS, or “Cascading Style Sheets,” is used for styling and laying out webpages. It can be used to adjust content size, spacing, color and font or add decorative features, such as animations or split content into columns.</p>
                <p>Since both HTML and CSS have a strong impact on how information appears, it’s crucial to understand the impact that CSS has on HTML. Simply put, web browsers follow CSS rules to determine how a document should be displayed.</p>

            <h2> JavaScript Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.  </p>
                <p>Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</li>
                <li>Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</li>

                <p>Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is versatile enough to be used for a variety of different applications, like software, hardware controls, and servers. JavaScript is most known for being a web-based language, because it's native to the web browser. The web browser can naturally understand the language, like how a native English speaker can naturally understand English.</p>
